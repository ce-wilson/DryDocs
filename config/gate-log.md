# HITL gate log

Append-only audit of guided-gate runs (see `docs/restructure/03-hitl-sme-flow.md`). Each run
records the date, the item, confirmed / edited / rejected counts, and reasons for any rejection.

## 2026-06-21 — C1 · Control-M ontology mapping
- **Presented:** 4 (batch — all reuse `status: active` vocabulary terms from the M3 model)
- **Confirmed:** 4 — `folder-scheduled-on`, `job-requires-in-condition`, `job-emits-out-condition`,
  `job-was-informed-by`
- **Edited:** 0 · **Rejected:** 0
- **Notes:** `SCHEDULED_ON` confirmed with a **null PROV mapping** on purpose — `ControlMServer`
  is local infrastructure, not an Agent, so `prov:wasAssociatedWith` would be invalid.
  `Folder CONTAINS_JOB → prov:hadMember` was already `applied`/live and not re-gated.
  Confirmed by SME (Confirm all 4).

## 2026-06-21 — C2 + C3 · BusinessApplication + LOB→Product→Team
- **Presented:** 8 batch (reuse active vocab) + 1 decision (SUPPORTS range)
- **Confirmed (8 batch):** app-has-port, app-has-membership, membership-of-role, membership-held-by
  (C2 — DPROD/ORG); lob-has-product-line, product-line-has-product, product-has-dev-team,
  lob-reconciles-to-segment (C3 — local + skos:closeMatch)
- **Decision resolved (SME):** `SUPPORTS` range = **AreaProduct** (not Product) — Product reached
  via Product▸AreaProduct▸DevTeam; "aligned to" = `team_type=aligned`. PLUS a new edge:
  **DevTeam DEVELOPS BusinessApplication, joined by SEALID** (cross-source, via catalog↔SEAL
  ownership reconciliation). Both recorded `confirmed`.
- **Edited:** 1 (SUPPORTS retargeted + DEVELOPS added) · **Rejected:** 0
- **C4 follow-up:** set `catalog_supports_area_product` + `arch_develops` active in the
  vocabulary; deprecate `catalog_supports` (DevTeam→Product).
