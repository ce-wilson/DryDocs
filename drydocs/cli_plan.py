"""Snapshot commands: snapshot, prune-snapshots.

S8 (2026-08-21): split out of drydocs/cli.py. The root stays the composition
root and the only module that may wire other components; this module holds
one domain's verbs and registers them on its own Typer, which the root merges
FLAT so `drydocs --help` lists the same names as before. Shared state
(console, registries, gates, adapters) lives in the root and is imported
from it; ``_client`` is resolved THROUGH the root at call time so tests that
monkeypatch ``drydocs.cli._client`` keep working.
